        <h1 style="font-size: larger;font-style: inherit;">What is Gourmet Farm</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;font-style: inherit;">A gourmet farm is usually a farm or agricultural operation that aims for premium quality, focusing on specialized, high-end, or niche produce (rather than mass commodity crops). Key features:

Growing fresh, high-flavor, high-quality foods — e.g. specialty herbs, organic vegetables, coffee, gourmet mushrooms, exotic fruits, etc.

Sustainable or eco-friendly practices: minimal pesticides/chemicals, sometimes organic certification, water-efficient methods, soil health, etc.

Often use advanced or controlled growing technologies: greenhouses, hydroponics, aeroponics, vertical farming, shade houses, etc.

Close to farm-to-table or direct supply chain: supplying restaurants, specialty stores, cafés or direct consumer sales.

Branding and presentation matter: packaging, freshness, traceability, sometimes agritourism (visits, café, events on the farm) are part of the business.</p>
